# HoloMedia

Custom media for my WeakAuras, https://wago.io/holodrum.

## Installation

1. Download this folder by clicking the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP".
1. Once you have the zip file downloaded, extract the folder. The folder name will be "HoloMedia" and inside should be the files and folders you see here.
1. Move the folder to your AddOns folder,

   On Windows, `C:\\World of Warcraft\_classic\Interface\Addons`
   On Mac, `Macintosh HD/Applications/World of Warcraft/_classic_/Interface/Addons`

   These are only the default folder locations for Classic, so double check you've got the right folder for the right game version on your computer.
1. Restart World of Warcraft if already running
